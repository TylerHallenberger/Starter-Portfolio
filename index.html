                    <h2>About Tyler</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>After spending time getting my Associates degree I decided that college might no be the best path for me.
                        I have always fulfilled roles that have been deemed too hard for my experience however, I succeed every time.
                        After taking multiple programming classes I found that it was something I wanted to focus on, as well as already having a 
                        passion for website design and usabilty.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. I've begun my journey to becoming a software 
                        developer and couldn't be happier</p>

                        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
